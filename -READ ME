PURPOSE:
‘CyberWar’ in one form or another has been prophesied for 35 years...
- Any major state sponsored actor (China, Russia, Iran) is going to want to keep the power on.  That’s the only way they can tell what we are doing.
- Minor threat actors (North Korea, Hacktivists, ISIS, etc) lack the time, money, and coordination to pull off a Black Swan Event. 
- Causing a power outage and keeping the power out are two different things.
- Yes, there is a risk, (info and physical) security at most power companies is pretty appalling, but that risk is nowhere near the level of hype that cyberwar hawks have been spouting.
- Squirrels.



DATA:
Data collection began in 2013 but was not formalized until probably 2015. Anything before 2013 is additional and mostly incidental. More effort was exerted after 2015 to attempt to formally collect everything. 2017 is the most complete year of data and the greatest effort was expended to be as complete as possible with the data. The effort dropped off in the later parts of 2018 making that year and subsequent years data incomplete. 


INCLUDED:
CS1_Docs.docx
CS1_Docs.txt
A MS word and text only version of the documentation of the CS1 data. This file was written to help an assistant understand the data and make new entries into the data set. This is a direct export of the original Google Docs file and may contain formatting errors due to the export.


CyberSquirrel-map_data.csv
A comma delimited file containing just the raw data of all animal caused power outages recorded by CS1.  Please refer to the CS1_Docs.txt or CS1_Docs.docx file to explain the various columns.


CyberSquirrel1.xlsx
A MS Excel file of the unedited export of the original Google Sheets spreadsheet including all tabs. There may be numerous formatting errors due to the export. Please refer to the CS1_Docs.txt or CS1_Docs.docx file to explain the various columns and subsequent tabs.

CREDIT:
The idea for Cyber Squirrel 1 came from a presentation by Josh Corman and Jericho given at the BruCoN conference in September 2012 and again at Thotcon in 2013 entitled "Cyberwar: Not what we were expecting".


THANKS:
Thank you to Josh Corman and jericho for the original idea. Many many thanks to jericho for assistance in collecting data in the later years and for being a stickler in our data collection practices. Thanks to Mathew Harper for stepping up and agreeing to be the sole data collector near the end of the project.
